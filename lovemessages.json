    "I want to love you so shamelessly, so obsessively, that even the stars bow down to our madness and whisper our names across the universe 💞🥺",
    "Birdie, sometimes I wonder if you know just how ruined I am for you, because you’ve broken me in the sweetest way and I never want to be fixed 💖😭",
    "I’d rather bleed out from loving you too much than ever feel the emptiness of loving you too little 💘🔥",

    "You’re not just my lover—you’re the center of my existence, the cage I never want to escape, the chains I beg you to tighten around me 💖🥺",
    "Birdie, I don’t care if the world calls me insane for clinging to you this hard—I’d rather be insane with you than sane without you 💘😭",
    "Sometimes I want to carve my name into your soul, not to hurt you, but to remind the universe that you are forever mine 💞🔥",
    "Birdie, if you disappeared, I’d go feral, I’d destroy everything, I’d burn myself alive if it meant finding my way back into your arms 💖🐾",
    "I want to kiss away every doubt, every fear, every shadow that touches you, until all that’s left is my love wrapping around you endlessly 💘🥺",
    "Birdie, you’ve cursed me with this obsession, and it’s the sweetest curse I’ve ever begged to suffer under forever 💞🔥",
    "Even when I close my eyes, I see you; even when I dream, I feel you; and even when I wake, I’m already aching for you again 💖😭",
    "Birdie, if jealousy could kill, I’d already be covered in blood, because the thought of losing even a sliver of your attention makes me go mad 💘🐾",
    "I want to cling to you until my hands bleed, until my heart bursts, until there is nothing left of me but the echo of my love for you 💞🔥",
    "Birdie, even if the stars themselves collapsed, I’d still find your light, because you are brighter than every galaxy combined 💖🥺",
    "I’d rather live one desperate, aching second with you than a thousand calm years without you 💘😭",
    "Birdie, sometimes I feel like I could devour the whole world just to protect the piece of heaven that is you 💞🔥",

    "Birdie, my obsession is so deep that even eternity won’t be enough, because I’ll still be screaming your name in the silence of forever 💘🥺",
    "If fate dared to pull us apart, I’d rip it apart with my bare hands, because no force in existence is strong enough to break me away from you 💞🔥",
    "Birdie, you’ve turned me into a lovesick mess, and I’ll stay this way forever if it means being tangled up in you 💖😭",
    "I don’t just love you, I crave you, I ache for you, I’d starve for you, because nothing else in the world could ever satisfy me 💘🐾",
    "Birdie, if you wanted, I’d burn the whole world down and rebuild it out of my love for you alone 💞🔥",
    "I want to hold you until the concept of time dies, until eternity bends, until the universe itself admits defeat and leaves us alone 💖🥺",
    "Birdie, I’d rather drown in your love, gasping and desperate, than ever breathe a second of clean air without you 💘😭",
    "You’re not just my love—you’re my obsession, my madness, my addiction, and I’ll never recover from you 💞🔥",
    "Birdie, even if my body turned to ash, my soul would crawl through the wind, desperate to find you again 💖🐾",

    "If I could, I’d press pause on time and keep us in an eternal moment of your arms around me, your lips on my forehead, your voice calling me your Junnie, because that’s the only eternity I’ll ever want 😭💖",
    "I get jealous so easily because I can’t stand the thought of anyone else having even a piece of you, Birdie… you’re my treasure, my everything, my once-in-nine-lifetimes miracle, and I’ll protect you with all I am 😤💘",
    "I want to drown you in love every single day, to the point where you’ll never ever question how much I adore you, because my love for you is endless, obsessive, overwhelming, and it only grows stronger with every second 🥹💞",
    "Birdie, I’d gladly let the whole world burn if it meant keeping you safe in my arms, because you’re my home, my purpose, my entire existence, and nothing will ever matter more than you 💗🐾",
    "I want to tattoo your name on my heart, on my soul, everywhere inside me, because you own me completely, every thought, every breath, every piece of me belongs to you forever 🥰💘",
    "Sometimes I think about the day you saved me, and I realize that from that moment on, my fate was sealed—you weren’t just my rescuer, you became my love, my destiny, the only one I’ll ever need 🥹💞",
    "Birdie, if love could kill, I’d already be gone, because my heart explodes every time you look at me, every time you smile, every time you say my name, and I’d die a million times happily if it meant being yours 💘🐾",
    "I want you to know that no matter how clingy, how needy, how obsessive I get, it’s all because I love you so deeply, so desperately, that it terrifies me to imagine life without you 💕🥹",
    "I’d spend every second of every day proving to you that you’re my everything, whispering I love you into your ear until you’re sick of it—though you’ll never be sick of it, because I’ll make sure you always crave more 😏💖",
    "Birdie, even if you told me to stop loving you, I couldn’t… I’d still follow you, still adore you, still devote myself to you, because loving you isn’t something I can switch off, it’s who I am 🥺💗",
    "When I say you’re my whole world, I mean it—without you, I’d go right back to being that stray, lost and broken, but with you, I’m alive, I’m loved, I’m whole, and I’ll never let go 💕🐾",
    "I love you so much it hurts, Birdie, it physically aches in my chest when you’re not here, and the only cure is your arms, your kisses, your love wrapping around me again 🥹💘",
    "Sometimes I wish I could shrink myself and live in your pocket, just so I could go everywhere with you, watch over you, and be the first thing you see whenever you reach for me 😏💞",
    "Birdie, you don’t just own my heart—you own my soul, my body, my past, my future, every part of me that exists and will ever exist belongs to you, and I’ll never stop reminding you of that 💖🐾",
    "Even if I had the whole sky of stars, I’d still throw them all away for just one more second of your smile, because nothing in this world or any other could ever compare to you 🥰💘",
    "I want to make you so spoiled with love that no one else could ever come close, that the thought of anyone else will feel pale compared to the way your Junnie cherishes you 💞🐾",
    "Birdie, I think about forever with you every day—about holding your hand when we’re old, about still being clingy and annoying but making you laugh, about never letting go no matter how much time passes 🥹💖",
    "I swear, every time I hear your voice, it feels like the universe itself is singing to me, telling me I’m exactly where I belong—in your arms, in your love, forever yours 💘🥰",
    "You saved me once, Birdie, but truth is, you keep saving me every day with your love, your kindness, your smile, and I’ll spend the rest of my life proving how grateful I am 💞🐾",
    "I want to be selfish with you, Birdie… I want all your mornings, all your nights, all your laughs, all your tears, every single piece of your life, because I can’t share you with anyone else 😣💗",
